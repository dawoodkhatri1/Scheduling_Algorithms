# Scheduling_Algorithms
Scheduling algorithms are techniques used by operating systems to manage the execution of processes by allocating CPU time efficiently. These algorithms optimize performance metrics like turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization based on specific criteria such as priority, arrival time, or burst time.
